        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A churro is a cinnamon- and sugar-topped fried pastry dough stick with Spanish and Portuguese origins. 
            Churros are similar to doughnuts, but they have ridges because they are piped out of a pastry bag. 
            Because they are fried instead of baked, churros have a fluffy and tender interior with a satisfyingly crispy exterior.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons white sugar</li>                
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>                
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>                
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>                
            <li>2 quarts oil for frying</li>                
            <li>½ cup white sugar, or to taste</li>                
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water, 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a small saucepan and place over medium heat. 
                Bring to a boil and remove from the heat. Stir in flour, stirring until mixture forms a ball.</li>
            <li>Heat oil for frying in a deep fryer or deep pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>                
            <li>Transfer the dough to a sturdy pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. Carefully pipe a few 5- to 6-inch strips of dough into the hot oil; 
                work in batches so you don't crowd the fryer. Cook until golden; use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer churros to paper towels to drain.</li>                
            <li>Combine 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Roll drained churros in cinnamon and sugar mixture.</li>
        </ol>
