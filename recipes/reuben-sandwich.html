        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A Reuben is a grilled sandwich featuring corned beef on rye bread. The Reuben is a menu staple in Jewish-style delicatessens, 
            but it's not technically kosher because it combines meat and cheese.  A traditional reuben sandwich consists of thinly sliced 
            corned beef, Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut on rye bread slathered with Russian or Thousand Island dressing.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 slices rye bread</li>
            <li>Â½ cup Thousand Island dressing</li>            
            <li>8 slices Swiss cheese</li>                
            <li>8 slices deli sliced corned beef</li>                
            <li>1 cup sauerkraut, drained</li>                
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a large griddle or skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Spread one side of bread slices evenly with Thousand Island dressing. On four bread slices, layer one slice Swiss cheese, 
                2 slices corned beef, 1/4 cup sauerkraut, and a second slice of Swiss cheese. Top with remaining bread slices, dressing-side down. 
                Butter the top of each sandwich.</li>                
            <li>Place sandwiches, butter-side down on the preheated griddle; butter the top of each sandwich with remaining butter. 
                Grill until both sides are golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Serve hot.</li>
